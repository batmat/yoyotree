= Simple Graph API (~Dojo)

Wrote this little API for a friend mostly to practice basic things. Use jgrapht or actual alternatives for graph processing/analysis.

This code can merely be interesting if you want to have a look at a short and working piece of code to handle graphs.
For example in a dojo or something like that.

== What this does

* Handles nodes by name (String) and their downstream relations
* API to find cycles from a given node
